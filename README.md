# An Extensive Empirical Comparison of Ensemble Learning Methods for Binary Classification

Here is the source code of a comparison study of ensemble learning method.

**Abstract**: We present an extensive empirical comparison between ninteen pro- totypical supervised ensemble learning algorithms, including Boosting, Bag- ging, Random Forests, Rotation Forests, Arc-X4, Class-Switching and their variants, as well as more recent techniques like Random Patches. These algo- rithms were compared against each other in terms of threshold, ranking/ordering and probability metrics over nineteen UCI benchmark data sets with binary labels. We also examine the influence of two base learners, CART and Ex- tremely Randomized Trees, on the bias-variance decomposition and the e↵ect of calibrating the models via Isotonic Regression on each performance metric. The selected data sets were already used in various empirical studies and cover di↵erent application domains. The source code and the detailed results of our study are publicly available.
